This directory contains 2 formulas :
  - [backuppc_add_client](./backuppc_add_client)
  - [backuppc_client](./backuppc_client)

The first one allow you to add a new client on the backuppc server.
The second one allow you to setup a correct client for your backuppc servers.

This code has been tested on Linux Debian/Ubuntu and on CentOS (but not really validated on this last one).

The pillar used is given [here](./backuppc_add_client/README.md).
